- [IMPORTANT] Replace the coach in `.github/CODEOWNERS` with your designated coach. This will ensure timely notifications when a Pull Request (PR) is made.


## Leetcode Code submission instructions 
- Commit messages must be the Leetcode problem, so that includes the problem number and problem title.
    - Example: 
- Commits must be made to a seperate branch (a feature branch), and not the main branch. Pull Requests (PRs) will be made to merge into the main branch. This will allow coaches to review your code and submissions.
    - Example:
- PR messages must include the leetcode problem number, loom link, and 2 - 3 word sentence summary.
  - If there are multiple commits(problems) per PR, then the PR must segment each Loom link and problem summary by Problem number using proper markdown (i.e. using separators in markdown to separate problems.)
